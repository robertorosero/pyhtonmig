Purpose

Attempt to develop some form of security model for Python.

1. Build Python as normal.
2. Run ``build_secure_py.sh`` to build ``secure_python.exe``.

Status
======
* Turn on whitelisting.
    - Verify injecting 'open' into importlib works.
* Write tests.
    - Import
        + Delegate protects importlib.
        + Whitelisting works.
            * Name fall-through to alternate implementation.
        + '.hidden' cannot be imported.
        + Removed modules cannot be imported (unless whitelisted).
    - Built-in namespace properly cleansed.
        + Nothing exposed through __builtin__ or __builtins__.
    - Types crippled.
