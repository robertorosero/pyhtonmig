=======
Purpose
=======
This branch is to try to track how memory is used throughout the interpreter.
The goal was to be able to ask questions like, "how many bytes are being used
by integers?" and the like.

The hope was that people would be able to tell where all of their memory usage
was going.  This could also help with finding reference leaks if a certain type
of object was taking up more memory than it was supposed to.

======
Status
======
Tracking "leaks" a few bytes after every pressing of Enter at an interpreter
prompt.

This branch was meant as a proof-of-concept of the idea.  It was to work out
how one could track pymalloc and malloc usage.
