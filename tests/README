==========
How to Use
==========

Run the test driver ``../run_security_tests.py`` with a standard Python
interpreter.  The driver will execute the scripts using 'subprocess' and the
``../secure_python.exe`` interpreter.

Types of Tests
==============

* succeed
    All tests in this directory represent code that should always work in a
    secured interpreter.

* fail
    Tests that contain code that should not work in a secured interpreter.  All
    insecure code should be contained with in proper try/except statements.
    The smallest amount of code required to test a security feature should be
    within each try/except statement (of which there may be several within a
    single file).
