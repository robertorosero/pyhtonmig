PYTHON DOCUMENTATION TO-DO LIST			-*- indented-text -*-
===============================

-------------------------------------------------------------
This list pertains only to the 1.5.2p2 documentation release.
-------------------------------------------------------------


Python/C API
------------

* The "Very High Level Interface" in the API document has been
  requested; I guess it wouldn't hurt to fill in a bit there.  Request 
  by Albert Hofkamp <a.hofkamp@wtb.tue.nl>.  (Partly done.)

* Python/C API reference is missing PyArg_ParseTuple(),
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords(), Py_BuildValue().  Information
  requested by Greg Kochanski <gpk@bell-labs.com>.

* PyEval_EvalCode() must also be documented.  Ask Guido about source
  comment: "Backward compatible interface".

* Break up the PyBufferProcs description so that the function types
  are independently described.  Perhaps break the chapter into
  sections for each of the *Procs interfaces.

* Make sure the reference count behavior of all the "exceptional"
  cases in the C API is documented in the API manual, and mentioned in 
  the extension manual if the function is mentioned.

* Ask Vladimir Marangozov <marangoz@python.inrialpes.fr> to document
  the memory allocation APIs; this could be part of his proposed
  cleanup.  ;)

* PyErr_SetInterrupt():  XXX comment about platform dependence should
  be resolved, or explain the problem.  Ask Guido for explanation.

* PySys_SetArgv() impl. doesn't seem consistent in allowing 0/NULL for
  the params; check w/ Guido.

Extending & Embedding
---------------------

* Describe implementing types in C, including use of the 'self'
  parameter to the method implementation function.  (Missing material
  mentioned in the Extending & Embedding manual, section 1.1; problem
  reported by Clay Spence <cspence@sarnoff.com>.)

* In the extensions manual, more information is needed about building
  dynamically linked extensions in C++.  Specifically, the extensions
  must be linked against the C++ libraries (and possibly runtime).
  Also noted by Albert Hofkamp <a.hofkamp@wtb.tue.nl>.

* Update the pickle documentation to describe all of the current
  behavior; only a subset is described.  __reduce__, etc.  Partial
  update submitted by Jim Kerr <jbkerr@sr.hp.com>.


Library Reference
-----------------

* Straighten out random/whrandom.  Things are generally in the right
  place, but need to respond to comments in email from Jan Kim
  <kim@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de>.
