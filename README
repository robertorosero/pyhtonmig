Python release 1.0.0 BETA 2
===========================

==> This is still a BETA release.  I've been furiously hacking over
    the past week.  If you think I've goofed up, please mail me an
    error report!

==> If you don't know yet what Python is: it's an interpreted,
    extensible, embeddable, interactive, object-oriented programming
    language.  For a quick summary of what Python can mean for a
    UNIX/C programmer, read Misc/BLURB.LUTZ.

==> If you want to start compiling right away (UNIX only): just type
    "make" in the current directory.  See the section Build
    Instructions below for more details.

==> If you want to know what's new since release 0.9.9: read
    Misc/NEWS.  Older history is in Misc/HISTORY.  [XXX Not in the
    BETA release yet.]

==> All documentation is in the subdirectory doc in the form of LaTeX
    files.  In order of importance for new users: Tutorial (tut),
    Library Reference (lib), Language Reference (ref), Extending
    (ext).  Note that especially the Library Reference is of immense
    value since much of Python's power (including the built-in data
    types and functions!) is described there.  [XXX The ext document
    has not been updated to reflect this release yet.]

==> Python is COPYRIGHTED but free to use for all.  See the copyright
    notice at the end of this file.


Build instructions
------------------

To build python, you normally simply type "make" in this directory.
The first time you do this, it will run the script "./configure",
which figures out your system configuration and creates the Makefiles
in most subdirectories.  It will then run "make" recursively in each
of the subdirectories Parser, Objects, Python and Modules, creating a
library file in each one.  The executable of the interpreter is built
in the Modules subdirectory but moved up here when it is built.

You can configure the interpreter to contain fewer or more built-in
modules by cd'ing to the Modules subdirectory, editing the file Setup
there, and running "make Makefile" followed by "make" there.  Read the
comments in the Setup file for more information.  You can also edit
Modules/Setup before running make from the toplevel directory; this
will automatically rebuild Modules/Makefile.

You can also build an "extended" interpreter, using modules that are
not contained in the Modules directory.  This is done in the
Extensions directory; read the README file there for more details.

Some special cases are handled by passing environment variables or
options to the configure script:

1) The configure script uses gcc (the GNU C compiler) if it finds it.
If you don't want this, or if this compiler is installed but broken on
your platform, pass "CC=cc" (or whatever the name of the proper C
compiler is) in the environment.

2) You can use the GNU readline library to improve the interactive
user interface: this gives you line editing and command history when
calling python interactively.  You need to build the GNU readline
library before running the configure script.  Pass it the option
--with-readline=DIRECTORY where DIRECTORY is the absolute pathname of
the directory where you've built the readline library.

3) Certain modules need to know whether you are running Sun SOLARIS
2.x.  I currently don't know a failsafe way to determine this, so you
have to pass the option --with-solaris to the configure script.  (This
is currently only needed when you use threads or the sunaudiodev
module.)

4) On SGI IRIX, and on Sun SOLARIS 2.x, you can use multiple threads.
To enable this, pass --with-thread.  On SOLARIS 2.x, also pass
--with-solaris.  In the Modules/Setup file, enable the thread module.

5) On SGI IRIX, there are modules that interface to many SGI specific
system libraries, e.g. the GL library and the audio hardware.  To
enable these modules, you must edit the Modules/Setup file (or use the
Setup.sgi file instead).

comments.

Grammar/	Input for the parser generator
Include/	Public header files
Lib/		Python library modules
Makefile	Rules for building the distribution
Misc/		Miscellaneous files
Modules/	Implementation of most built-in modules
Objects/	Implementation of most built-in object types
Parser/		The parser and tokenizer and their input handling
Python/		The "compiler" and interpreter
README		The file you're reading now
TODO		A list of things that aren't finished yet
config.status	status from last run of configure script (not distributed)
configure	Configuration shell script (GNU autoconf output)
configure.in	Configuration specification (GNU autoconf input)

Ftp access
----------

The latest Python source distribution can be ftp'ed from site
ftp.cwi.nl (IP address 192.16.184.180), directory /pub/python, file
python<version>.tar.Z.  You can also find PostScript of the main
Python documentation there, Macintosh and PC binaries, and the latest
STDWIN source distribution (in directory /pub/stdwin).  Mirror sites
are gatekeeper.dec.com (/pub/plan/python/cwi) and ftp.uu.net
(/languages/python) -- try these sites first if you are on the US
continent, or at least closer to it than to Europe.

If you don't have ftp access, send mail containing only the word HELP
to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the
server will send you instructions on how to make requests.


Mailing list
------------

There is a mailing list devoted to Python programming, design and
bugs.  To subscribe, send mail containing your real name and e-mail
address in Internet form to "python-list-request@cwi.nl".  If you have
built and installed Python, you are urgently to subscribe to this
mailing list.
