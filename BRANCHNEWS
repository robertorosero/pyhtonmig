Core and builtins
-----------------

* Make importing the sys module after it has been completely deleted use the
  interpreter's sysdict instead of the cached dict used by the import
  machinery.  This lets the sys module be deleted for security reasons during
  startup.

* rev. ????: Added a delegate for import that calls sys.import_ in
  sys.import_delegate.

* rev. 51679: Remove the constructor for the 'code' type.  This means instances
  of the 'code' type cannot be created directly.  You must use the new
  objcap.code_new() factory function to create instances.

* rev. 51672: Remove the initializer from the 'file' type.  Constructing an
  isntance now takes no arguments and makes it an empty instance.  To attach a
  file to a 'file' instance, use objcap.file_init().

  This changes how subclassing 'file' needs to be handled.  First,
  file.__new__() must be called with no arguments.  Second, in the subclass'
  __init__(), call objcap.file_init() with 'self' as the first argument and
  then the usual arguments for opening a file.

* rev. 51392: Introduce objcap module to hold removed functions/methods.  Begin
  with moving object.__subclasses__().


Library
-------

* Change the codecs module so that it does not import the entire sys module and
  thus hold a reference to it.
