Core and builtins
-----------------

* rev. 51656: Remove initializer from 'file'.  By leaving tp_new alone you can
  still subclass 'file' (although its usefulness as a subclass is doubtful when
  its tp_init is empty and that is what actually opens the file descriptor).
  Created a new function, PyFile_UnsafeOpen() which is what the built-in open()
  function is now set to.  Also changed the bz2 module to use it.

  Still need to decide how to handle subclasses of 'file' so they are not
  totally useless (special function that calls the needed initializer on a
  'file' object?).  Also need to come up with C API that opens files through
  the built-in open() instead of doing it directly so as to not bypass
  security.

* rev. 51392: Introduce objcap module to hold removed functions/methods.  Begin
  with moving object.__subclasses__().
