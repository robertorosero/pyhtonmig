* Store old __import__ into __old_import__ and use importlib.  Required
  introducing a somewhat fake file object that uses posix and file descriptors
  as open() is defined in site.py which obviously has not been imported yet.

* Add _r_long() and _w_long() to marshal.

* Add _case_ok() to imp.

* Add _PyImport_Importlib() to import _importlib.  This also involves importing
  errno, sys, imp, marshal and _os (which can be either nt, os2, or posix;
  reason why PyOS_MODNAME and PyOS_INITFUNC have been added).  Also inject SEP
  as path_sep into _importlib.

* Add Py_GetImportlibPath() as a way to get the path to _importlib.

* Have Modules/getpath.c use _importlib.py instead of os.py when searching for
  Python's stdlib directory.
