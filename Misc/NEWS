Overview of changes
-------------------

For the list of change below, I have borrowed from the document
"What's New in Python 2.0" by Andrew Kuchling and Moshe Zadka:
http://starship.python.net/crew/amk/python/writing/new-python/.

There are lots of new modules and lots of bugs have been fixed.  To
find out about new modules, check out the library manual, which has
been enhanced significantly.

Probably the most pervasive change is the addition of Unicode support.
We've added a new fundamental datatype, the Unicode string, a new
build-in function unicode(), an numerous C APIs to deal with Unicode
and encodings.  See the file Misc/unicode.txt for details, or
http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/unicode-proposal.txt.

Two other big changes, related to the Unicode support, are the
addition of string methods and (yet another) new regular expression
engine.

  - String methods mean that you can now say s.lower() etc. instead of
  importing the string module and saying string.lower(s) etc.  One
  peculiarity is that the equivalent of string.join(sequence,
  delimiter) is delimiter.join(sequence).  Use " ".join(sequence) for
  the effect of string.join(sequence); to make this more readable, try
  space=" " first.

  - The new regular expression engine, SRE by Fredrik Lundh, is fully
  backwards compatible with the old engine, and is in fact invoked
  using the same interface (the "re" module).  You can explicitly
  invoke the old engine by import pre, or the SRE engine by importing
  sre.  SRE is faster than pre, and supports Unicode (which was the
  main reason to put effort in yet another new regular expression
  engine -- this is at least the fourth!).

Several small incompatible library changes may trip you up:

  - The append() method for lists can no longer be invoked with more
  than one argument.  This used to append a single tuple made out of
  all arguments, but was undocumented.  To append a tuple, use
  e.g. l.append((a, b, c)).

  - The connect(), connect_ex() and bind() methods for sockets require
  exactly one argument.  Previously, you could call s.connect(host,
  port), but this was undocumented. You must now write
  s.connect((host, port)).

  - The str() and repr() functions are now different more often.  For
  long integers, str() no longer appends a 'L'.  Thus, str(1L) == '1',
  which used to be '1L'; repr(1L) is unchanged and still returns '1L'.
  For floats, repr() now gives 17 digits of precision, to ensure no
  precision is lost (on all current hardware).

  - The -X option is gone.  Built-in exceptions are now always
  classes.  Many more library modules also have been converted to
  class-based exceptions.

Other changes that won't break code but are nice to know about:

- Greg Ward's "distutils" package is included: this will make
installing, building and distributing third party packages much
simpler.

- There's now special syntax that you can use instead of the apply()
function.  f(*args, **kwds) is equivalent to apply(f, args, kwds).
You can also use variations f(a1, a2, *args, **kwds) and you can leave
one or the other out: f(*args), f(**kwds).

- The built-ins int() and long() take an optional second argument to
indicate the conversion base -- of course only if the first argument
is a string.  This makes string.atoi() and string.atol() obsolete.
(string.atof() was already obsolete).

- When a local variable is known to the compiler but undefined when
used, a new exception UnboundLocalError is raised.  This is a class
derived from NameError so code catching NameError should still work.
The purpose is to provide better diagnostics in the following example:

  x = 1
  def f():
      print x
      x = x+1

This used to raise a NameError on the print statement, which confused
even experienced Python programmers (especially if there are several
hundreds of lines of code between the reference and the assignment to
x :-).

- You can now override the 'in' operator by defining a __contains__
method.  Note that it has its arguments backwards: x in a causes
a.__contains__(x) to be called.  That's why the name isn't __in__.
