For 1.0.1:
	- Mac version
	- info tar file
	- Extensions

- document new modules (builtin as well as Lib)

- restart CVS tree

- fix Extensions

- make freeze script working again (use Extensions/mkext.py as a base?)

- add a std module to import packages

Incorporate with contrib status:
- additions to glmodule by rg3h
- Jaap's posixfile module (with locking)
- pthreads interface

Later:
- put the offending object in IOError and posix.error
- make module marshal work with user-defined file-like objects
- built-in help?
- hierarchical module names?
- export file.softspace
