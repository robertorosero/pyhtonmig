TODO in slice removal:

 - Fix compiler-package to avoid SLICE opcodes
 - Add tests for the extended slicing abilities of:
    buffer
    mmap.mmap
    structseq
 - Add extended slicing (or at least slice-object support) to ctypes objects
 - Make list's mp_[ass_]subscr not depend on list_[ass]slice
 - Remove slice API (or emulate it ontop of sliceobject API)
 - Further remove slice/ass_slice PySequenceMethod hooks
 - Figure out what to do with PyMapping_Check (it uses the presence of the
   classic slicing hook to tell sequences-with-extended-slicing from
   mappings.)
