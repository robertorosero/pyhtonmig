TODO in slice removal:

 - Clean up compilerpackage's code now that SLICE opcodes are gone
 - Add non-step-1 slicing to ctypes objects
 - Add non-step-1 slice assignment to UserString.MutableString
 - Make list's mp_[ass_]subscr not depend on list_[ass]slice
 - Remove slice API (or emulate it ontop of sliceobject API)
 - Further remove slice/ass_slice PySequenceMethod hooks
 - Figure out what to do with PyMapping_Check (it uses the presence of the
   classic slicing hook to tell sequences-with-extended-slicing from
   mappings.)
 - Refactor slice handling logic from all the sequency types into a single
   location? Might need some funky macros to make work...
 - Submit type enhancements to trunk, rest to p3yk
