make freeze script working again (use Extensions/mkext.py as a base?)

Put PostScript on archive site

Incorporate with contrib status:

- pthreads interface

Later:
- put the offending object in IOError and posix.error
- make module marshal work with user-defined file-like objects
- built-in help
- hierarchical module names
- have a look at latex2info
- PC binary
- fix FAQ
